[Deepflame] Engineering
=================================
Deepflame Engineering introduces some additional recipes to the Basic Engineering specialization, to make it a bit more flexible and relevant beyond crafting roads ad nauseum.

Wooden Gearbox
---------------------------------
Introducing the Wooden Gearbox, a new item that is used as part of several recipes, it is also a part item that will need occasional maintenance.
Some of its uses are in:
- Small Wooden Boat; Replaces the Gearbox from Mechanics with the Wooden Gearbox from Basic Engineering, allowing Shipwrights to build their product earlier in the game's cycle.
- Powered Cart; Reduced lubricant and wood board cost, but added the wooden gearbox. This doesn't change the cost much, but as a part item it means the engineer should continue to have customers.
- Windmill and Waterwheel; Replaces some of the lubricant during crafting, and fully replaces Lubricant as a part item.

Wooden Gears
---------------------------------
Wooden Gears have had their resource cost reduced from 4 hewn logs to 3 hewn logs.

Some objects now have had Wooden Gears added to their recipes, providing the engineer with a demand for his product:
- Arrastra
- Mechanical Water Pump

Recycling
---------------------------------
Finally, a means to dispose of certain products has been added to the Stamp Mill. Mulch away!
